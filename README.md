# 8-mer-peptides-TcdB
This repository contains the data and codes associated with the paper-Development of Peptide Glucosyltransferase Inhibitors with Comprehensive Coverage across Clostridioides difficile Toxin B Sub-Types. 

# Requirement and Installation
The source codes are in /code/. Compiler such as gfortran or ifort is required

# Data for paper
/SB1 to SB7, LSB5/-These directories contains the following files:
1. SB1-SB7: Each folder contains the topology file and final PDB file from a 100 ns simulation for runs 1 to 3
2. LSB5: Each folder contains the topology file and final PDB file from a 100 ns simulation for runs 1 to 3

# The peptide design code (PepBD) code is available in this repo: https://github.com/CarolHall-NCSU-CBE/8-mer-peptides-TcdA
